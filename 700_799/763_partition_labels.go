/*
A string S of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as
many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list
of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:

Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less
parts.

Note:
S will have length in range [1, 500].
S will consist of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') only.
